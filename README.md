List of radio observatories with their coordinates
==================================================

The observatories with their langitude and latitude (WGS84) are taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_radio_telescopes). The elevation is retrieved with the [Google Maps Elevation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/start). Corrections and additions are welcome. Please put the source into a `reference` field of the entry if you do a commit or pull request.

This compilation is under the [Creative Commons CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0) license. That means you can copy, modify, distribute, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

For convenience, a simple Python 3 script is added to convert the table into the casacore `Observatories` data table.
